# The profit models

## Basic profit model (Elementary):

GIVEN:
- 2 crypto exchanges A and B
- 2 crypto assets x and y that are both available on A and B. Ax means x on A

<p align="center">
PROFIT = |𝜟x| + |𝜟y| - COST
</br>
𝜟x = |Ax - Bx|
</br>
𝜟y = |Ay - By|
</p>

COST is the sum of the following:
- Cost of buying x on A
- Cost of transferring x from A -> B
- Cost of selling x on B
- Cost of buying y on B
- Cost of transferring y from B -> A
- Cost of selling y on A

If PROFIT is positive, then this model is profitable.

Condition for PROFIT > 0:

<p align="center">
Ax > Bx
</br>
By > Ay
</br>
|𝜟x| + |𝜟y| > COST
</p>
